# SimplePHP-DB - A Lightweight & Simple PHP Database Class

SimplePHP-DB is a lightweight & simple PHP database class. Currently at version 2.0, it's now built using PDO.

I built it to help get consistent DB interactions on simple PHP scripts (migrations, independent automated crons, etc.).

## Usage

The sample.php uses all methods and everything else is pretty well documented in the DB class file itself.

You can still call PDO and PDOStatement methods directly. It's used in the sample.php file as well.

## Features

* Simple query, single execute (query and fetch), execute ( query and fetch all), and other helpful methods.
* Lightweight
* PDO/PDOStatement method usage

## Dev features

* Namespaces
* PHPDoc comments

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3.0+ required
* PHP PDO
